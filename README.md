# Dev Portfolio 

This website was designed for the purpose of letting future employers/ employees know a little bit about myself and the projects I will be creating as a student at UMN bootcamp.

I had some ups and downs with the creation of this webpage. I had to do lots of extra research especially on flexbox, and talked with some classmates on how to best structure different sections. Overall this project taught me LOTS of things I didnt know about CSS.
